# Step 3: Create a Database User (Super Easy Guide!)

## What is a Database User?

Think of it like this: Your chess app needs a **username and password** to access the database (like logging into a website). We're creating those credentials now.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 3.1: Find the Left Sidebar

Look at the **left side** of your screen. You should see a menu with options like:
- Database
- **Database Access** ← This is what we need!
- Network Access
- Security
- etc.

**Can't find it?** Look for any menu on the left side of the page.

### Step 3.2: Click "Database Access"

1. Find **"Database Access"** in the left sidebar
2. Click on it
3. You'll see a new page

### Step 3.3: Click "Add New Database User"

On the new page, you'll see:
- A button that says **"Add New Database User"** or **"Create Database User"** or **"Add User"**
- It's usually a green or blue button
- Click it!

### Step 3.4: Fill Out the Form

You'll see a form with several boxes. Here's what to do:

#### Box 1: Authentication Method
- You'll see options like "Password" or "Certificate"
- **Choose "Password"** (it's probably already selected)
- Don't change anything here

#### Box 2: Username
- You'll see a box that says "Username" or "Database Username"
- Type in: `chessuser`
  - (You can use any name, but `chessuser` is easy to remember)
- This is like your login name

#### Box 3: Password
This is the **most important part!**

**Option A: Auto-generate (Easiest)**
1. Look for a button that says **"Autogenerate Secure Password"** or **"Generate Password"**
2. Click it
3. A password will appear (looks like random letters and numbers)
4. **COPY THIS PASSWORD RIGHT NOW!** 
   - Click the "Copy" button next to it, OR
   - Select all the text and press Ctrl+C
5. **Save it somewhere safe** (write it down, save in a text file, etc.)
   - You'll need it in a few minutes!

**Option B: Create Your Own**
1. Type a password you'll remember
2. Make it strong (mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
3. **Write it down!**

#### Box 4: Database User Privileges
- You'll see options like "Atlas admin", "Read and write", etc.
- **Choose "Atlas admin"** (it's probably already selected)
- Don't change this

### Step 3.5: Click "Add User"

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the form
2. Look for a button that says:
   - **"Add User"** (most common)
   - **"Create User"**
   - **"Save"**
3. Click it!

### Step 3.6: Success!

You should see:
- A message like "User created successfully"
- OR your new user will appear in a list
- The username you created should be visible

**Great job!** 🎉

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Save Your Password!

**Before you move on**, make sure you have:
- ✅ Your **username** (probably `chessuser`)
- ✅ Your **password** (the one you copied or created)

**Write them down somewhere safe!** You'll need them in Step 5.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I don't see 'Database Access' in the sidebar"**
- Look for "Security" → then "Database Access"
- Or try clicking different menu items until you find it
- It might be under a different name like "Users" or "Access Control"

**"I can't find 'Add New Database User' button"**
- Look for any button that says "Add", "Create", or "New"
- It might be at the top right of the page
- Or in the middle of the page

**"I forgot to copy the password!"**
- If you auto-generated it, you'll need to create a new user
- Click "Add New Database User" again
- This time, make sure to copy the password!

**"The form looks confusing"**
- Don't worry! Just fill in:
  - Username: `chessuser`
  - Password: Click "Autogenerate" and copy it
  - Everything else: Leave as default
- Then click "Add User"
