# Step 2: Create Your Database

## What You Should See Now

You should be logged into MongoDB Atlas and see a dashboard. Look for:

- A button that says **"Build a Database"** or **"Create"** or **"New Project"**
- OR you might see a page asking "What would you like to do first?"
- OR you might see a sidebar on the left with options

## Step 2.1: Click "Build a Database"

1. Look for a big button that says **"Build a Database"** (usually green or blue)
2. Click it

## Step 2.2: Choose the FREE Option

You'll see different database options. Look for:

- **FREE** or **M0** (this is the free tier - it's perfect for your chess app!)
- It should already be selected/highlighted
- **Don't change anything!** Just click **"Create"** or **"Create Cluster"**

**Important:** 
- The FREE option is completely free forever
- You don't need to enter a credit card
- It's perfect for your chess app

## Step 2.3: Wait for Setup

After clicking "Create":
- You'll see a message like "Deploying your cluster" or "Creating cluster"
- This takes 1-3 minutes
- You'll see a progress bar or spinning icon
- **Just wait!** Don't click anything else

## Step 2.4: Success!

When it's done, you'll see:
- A message like "Cluster created successfully"
- OR you'll see your cluster listed (might say "Cluster0" or similar)
- The status will change from "Creating" to "Idle" or "Ready"

**Great job! Your database is being created!** 🎉

## What If...

**"I don't see 'Build a Database' button"**
- Look for "Create" or "New Project" instead
- Or check if you're on a different page - try clicking "Database" in the left sidebar

**"It's asking for a credit card"**
- Make sure you selected the FREE (M0) option
- You should NOT need a credit card for the free tier
- If it's still asking, look for a "Skip" or "Continue with free" option

**"It's been more than 5 minutes"**
- This is normal! Sometimes it takes a few minutes
- Just wait, it will finish

## ✅ When You're Done

Once your cluster is created and shows "Ready" or "Idle", tell me:
- "Step 2 is done"
- "My database is ready"
- "I see the cluster"

And I'll help you with Step 3! 😊
